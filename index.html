                My boyfriend, Danny, and I really love
                 National Parks. Camping, hiking, and being outside is our jam.
                 Our goal is to every single national park, and in our three years together 
                 we've seen ten of the fifty eight.

            <p> This is a story about a cross country road trip and the perils of driving 
                the open highways.</p>

                <h3>In May of 2017 we had a bright idea.</h3>
            <p>We decided to go on a cross country road trip from St. Louis, Missouri, to Bend, 
                Oregon, to visit my family and see some national parks along the way. We'd drive 
                west all day and all night through Kansas to Colorado, stopping at Black Canyon of the Gunnison 
                and the Great Sand Dunes, cut through Utah and Idaho and be in Oregon within three days. </p>
                
                <h3>The plan was simple. Two Weeks, Six Parks, and about 4,000 miles.</h3>
                
                <p>What could go wrong?</p>
        </section>
            <section>
            <h3>So we hit the road.</h3>

            <p>At first, everything went according to plan. We blew through Kansas the first night and 
                    made it to Gunnison the next morning.</p>

            <p> We set up camp to nap and then hit the road to 
                reach the Dunes by early afternoon.</p>

                <h4>Things get hairy...</h4>
            
                <p>  We drove through the rest of the evening, and I got the night shift. Driving all night was tough. You'd think fatigue would have been my main concern, 
                    but the true peril came in all the animals who roam in the middle of nowhere.
                On several occassions, I would have to come to a complete stop on the highway to avoid hitting deer. 
                I'd stop and honk and they'd look at me, unphased. Danny remained sound asleep next to me, 
                as unphased as they were.
            </p>
            
            <p>Though I was exhausted, I managed to get us into Oregon by sunrise. Then Danny took 
                over until we stopped for lunch, about 45 minutes from my house. I texted my dad to 
                let him know we'd be there within the hour. I offered to drive the last stretch so 
                Danny could get some additional rest before entering the chaos that is my family home.</p>

                    <h2>Tragedy strikes.</h2>
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, three deer are sprinting besides me on the highway. I slam on the brakes 
                    but it is too late, they've changed course and are darting in front of Danny's tiny Mini Cooper.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We always said we would probably die if we hit a deer in that little car, but thankfully we were wrong.

                    <h3>One tow truck ride, several days of panic, and a pressing deadline later...</h3>

                <p>We found a solution! My Grandmother would sell me her car for the price of its current value, 
                    and we could be on our way back to the Lou in time for Danny to start his summer internship.
